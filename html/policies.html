        <h3>Electric Car Incentive
            <div class="bar">

            </div>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The "Electric Car Incentive" policy aims to steer the automotive industry away from traditional, fossil-fuel-based vehicles to more environmentally friendly electric cars. Under this policy, the economic gains from conventional car factories are slashed by 50% to disincentivize their production. In contrast, tech factories, which often produce components crucial for electric vehicles like batteries, see a 10% increase in economic gains. This policy reflects a strategic shift toward reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change but could be met with resistance in regions heavily reliant on traditional automotive manufacturing.

        <h3>Deforestation Ban  <div class="bar">
                
            </div></h3>
        <p>
            The "Deforestation Ban" policy directly targets the mining industry, eliminating its ability to consume forest resources. While this is a significant step towards preserving biodiversity and combating climate change, it comes at a financial cost. The policy reduces the economic gains from mining by 30% due to the loss of forest resources. Such a policy might be popular in countries with dwindling forest reserves but can face backlash in nations where mining is a key part of the economy.

        </p>

    <div class="policy">
        <h3>Carbon Tax  <div class="bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>
            The "Carbon Tax" policy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by imposing taxes on specific resource consumption. For car factories, coal consumption is cut by 10%, and economic gains are reduced by 20% due to the added tax. Similarly, plastic factories will see a 10% reduction in oil consumption and a 15% reduction in economic gains. This policy is designed to financially disincentivize practices contributing to climate change. However, it could be unpopular in countries where these industries are significant employers or economic drivers.

        <h3>Renewable Energy Incentives  <div class="bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>
            The "Renewable Energy Incentives" policy encourages factories, particularly in the textile industry, to switch from oil to solar power. Under this policy, oil consumption for these factories drops to zero, and solar power usage increases. Additionally, factories receive a 10% boost in economic gains due to lower energy costs. This policy aims to accelerate the transition to clean energy, though its success will largely depend on the availability and affordability of renewable energy infrastructure.

        </p>

    <div class="policy">
        <h3>Water Conversation  <div class="bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>
            The "Water Conservation" policy aims to manage water resources more effectively, particularly within the agriculture sector. It mandates a 20% reduction in water consumption, which, while beneficial for the environment, leads to a 10% reduction in economic gains for these factories. This could be a critical policy for countries experiencing water scarcity but may be difficult to implement in agricultural communities reliant on water-intensive practices.

        </p>

    <div class="policy">
        <h3>Education and Training <div class="bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>
            The "Education and Training" policy is an all-encompassing initiative designed to boost productivity across all industrial sectors. By investing in the workforce, this policy enables a 20% increase in productivity and a subsequent 10% increase in economic gains for all factories. While it does not directly target environmental concerns, the increased efficiency could lead to fewer resources being consumed per unit of output, thus having an indirect positive impact on the environment.
        </p>

        <div class="policy">
        <h3>Waste Recycling Initiative <div class="bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>
            This policy aims to reduce environmental pollution and waste by encouraging the recycling of materials in plastic and tech factories. By implementing recycling systems, factories can not only reduce the consumption of land but also boost their economic gains by selling recycled materials. This policy also encourages the growth of recycling factories across countries, thereby enhancing the nation's overall sustainability.
        </p>

        <div class="policy">
        <h3>Green Infrastructure <div class="bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>
            The Green Infrastructure policy aims to reduce the carbon footprint of construction projects by encouraging the use of renewable resources. It eliminates the use of coal and incorporates solar power to meet energy requirements. Although this might incur a higher initial cost, reflected by a slight decrease in economic gains, it paves the way for a more sustainable future. It also promotes the establishment of solar power factories, contributing to the green energy grid.
        </p>

        <div class="policy">
        <h3>Sustainable Farming Practices <div class="bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>
            This policy encourages agricultural sectors to adopt more sustainable farming techniques. It aims to reduce the consumption of both water and land resources by promoting efficient irrigation systems and sustainable land management. Moreover, it creates an economic incentive for farmers by increasing the demand for organic produce, thereby boosting the economic gains. This policy also promotes the growth of organic farming, benefiting both the environment and human health.
