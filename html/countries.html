            <div class="mini-ruler">

            </div>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Norlandia is a highly developed country located in the Northern Hemisphere, often praised for its technological advancements and commitment to environmental sustainability. With a diverse industrial sector including technology, automotive, and renewable energy, it has managed to balance economic growth with relatively low pollution levels. However, the country's population of 100 million still contributes to air pollution and waste generation. Policies promoting renewable energy have allowed Norlandia to maintain a low total pollution level of 50, and they have a higher tolerance for pollution at 70, but public discourse is increasingly focusing on achieving zero emissions. The happiness level is high at 85, reflecting public satisfaction with government policies and living conditions. However, there is growing concern about the depletion of natural resources like coal, and how that might impact the country's robust economy valued at $3.5 trillion.

            <div class="mini-ruler">

            </div>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Sudoria is a growing economic force in Africa, with an emphasis on mining and agriculture. Despite being resource-rich, the country has a high pollution level of 80, primarily due to unregulated industrial activities and deforestation. The government faces the challenge of balancing economic growth, represented by its $1.5 trillion GDP, with sustainable practices that can preserve its limited natural resources like oil and coal. Happiness levels are moderate at 65, suggesting that the population is somewhat content but affected by issues like pollution and possibly poverty. Policies aimed at reducing pollution may be met with resistance, given the country's high tolerance for pollution at 100 and the immediate economic benefits that industries bring.

            <div class="mini-ruler">

            </div>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Estasia, located in Asia, is a manufacturing giant with a booming electronics sector. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, it is one of the world's most populous countries, contributing to its high pollution level of 90. Its large scale industrial activities in electronics, machinery, and garments also contribute significantly to air and water pollution. However, a robust economy valued at $11 trillion provides the government with resources to enact change. Despite the high pollution, happiness levels are relatively high at 75, likely due to economic prosperity. Policy shifts toward sustainability could be complex and slow-moving, given the massive scale of industrial production and the high tolerance for pollution at 100.

            <div class="mini-ruler">

            </div>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Westhaven, a North American nation, is a leader in the software and automotive industries. With a highly diversified economy valued at $19 trillion, it faces the challenge of managing moderate pollution levels—currently standing at 60—against the backdrop of significant industrial activity. Happiness levels are high at 80, which could be indicative of a higher standard of living and better air quality compared to other industrial nations. However, given the country's lower natural resources like oil and coal, any policies aimed at drastic pollution reduction could potentially disrupt economic stability unless alternative energy sources are found.

            Australen
            <div class="mini-ruler">

            </div>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Australen spans territories in South America and Australia, offering a unique blend of natural beauty and industrial prowess. Despite a smaller population of 25 million, the country has a significant mining sector, contributing to a total pollution level of 55. With an economy valued at $1.5 trillion, the nation enjoys a high happiness level of 82. Given its unique geographic span, policies to combat pollution in Australen would need to account for diverse ecosystems ranging from rainforests to arid lands. Although the tolerance for pollution is high at 100, there is increasing public pressure to invest more in sustainable practices, particularly in the tourism and agriculture sectors.
