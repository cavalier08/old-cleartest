        <h3>Tech Factory
            <div class="mini-bar">

            </div>
        </h3>
        <p>The Tech Factory primarily relies on oil, consuming 2 units per production cycle. Given its high economic output of 1200, it's a lucrative industry but poses challenges for countries trying to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels. Policies aimed at reducing oil consumption can significantly affect this industry.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="industry">
        <h3>Car Factory<div class="mini-bar">
                
            </div></h3>
        <p>This factory is a significant contributor to both coal and oil consumption, requiring 3 and 5 units respectively. With an economic gain of 800, it's crucial for many countries' manufacturing sectors. However, it's also a leading contributor to air pollution, making it a prime target for environmental policies like carbon taxes and electric car incentives.

        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="industry">
        <h3>Mining Factory<div class="mini-bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>Dependent on forest resources, consuming 2 units per production cycle, the Mining Factory can significantly contribute to deforestation. It has an economic gain of 1000, making it financially valuable but environmentally costly. Countries rich in forests need to balance economic and environmental priorities when dealing with this industry.

    </div>
    <div class="industry">
        <h3>Renewable Energy Factory<div class="mini-bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>Despite its name, this factory still relies on coal and oil, consuming 4 and 2 units respectively. However, its high economic output of 1500 makes it attractive for countries looking to transition to cleaner forms of energy. This industry would benefit most from renewable energy incentives.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="industry">
        <h3>Tech Factory<div class="mini-bar">

        </div></h3>
        <p>Consuming 1 unit of coal and forests each, the Agriculture Factory isn't the most resource-intensive but can still pose environmental challenges. With an economic gain of 600, it's essential for food production, making policies like water conservation critical yet sensitive topics for this industry.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="industry">
        <h3>Textile Factory<div class="mini-bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>Relying on coal and forests, consuming 2 and 1 units respectively, the Textile Factory contributes to both air pollution and deforestation. Its economic output is 700, and policies like renewable energy incentives could help this industry become more sustainable.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="industry">
        <h3>Electronics Factory<div class="mini-bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>Consuming 2 units of coal and 3 of oil, the Electronics Factory is another high-polluting industry. It has an economic gain of 1300, making it a lucrative but environmentally harmful sector. This factory would be affected by carbon taxes and other policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel consumption.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="industry">
        <h3>Machinery Factory<div class="mini-bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>Using 3 units of coal and 2 of oil, the Machinery Factory is resource-intensive. Its economic gain is 1100, and like the Car Factory, it is a significant contributor to air pollution. Policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel usage will have a significant impact on this industry.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="industry">
        <h3>Garments Factory<div class="mini-bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>This factory uses 1 unit each of coal and oil, making it one of the less resource-intensive factories. However, with an economic output of just 500, it could be more vulnerable to policies that reduce fossil fuel consumption, such as carbon taxes.


        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="industry">
        <h3>Software Factory<div class="mini-bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>Primarily relying on oil, consuming 3 units, the Software Factory is less resource-diverse but has a high economic output of 2000. Despite being less physically polluting, its dependence on oil makes it subject to policies reducing fossil fuel use.


        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="industry">
        <h3>Tourism Factory<div class="mini-bar">
                
        </div></h3>
        <p>Consuming 2 units of coal, the Tourism Factory is not overly resource-intensive but can be impacted by public perception of a country's environmental policies. With an economic gain of 900, it is in the mid-range but could be significantly affected by global attitudes toward sustainable travel.
